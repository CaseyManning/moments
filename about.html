        <p>moments is my journal mostly. casey's journal.</p>
        <p>these days i think of a moment as maybe half poem, half journal.</p>
        <p>
          a long time ago moments were just about publishing anything at all,
          and were more clearly vignettes from my life. i could feel it all
          slipping through my fingers without moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          now they are more vignettes of a mental landscape. i think im less
          interested in concrete happenings, but i still feel very strongly
          about the moment as a sort of snapshot, a particular way of engaging
          with my experience of things.
